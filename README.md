# Push Notifications Android Application and Webapp(PHP) using Google Cloud Messaging
It is common for mobile applications to act as a client in client/server systems. In that scenario, it is often useful to notify the 
client of certain events (such as when a new message has been received on the server), and it is convenient to have a way for the server 
to communicate this information to the client without requiring the client to request it. This type of communication is called a 
push notification. This push notifications tutorial describes how to configure an Android application to receive push notifications via 
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), in conjunction with an application server.
